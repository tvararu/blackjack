Blackjack
===

A very basic game of Blackjack, part of an interview test, implemented using just plain ES6 and some TDD. Probably only runs on Chrome/Firefox.

Probably has bugs. Relies a lot on pure functions, and the main state machine is described using a [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)-like reducer.

Testing
===

```
npm i
npm test
```
